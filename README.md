# Timeline

Are you struggling with the limitations of the Salesforce Activity Timeline in Financial Services Cloud (FSC)? In this video, I break down the top issues Salesforce users face with the standard activity timeline—and more importantly, how to solve them.

As a Salesforce Architect specializing in FSC, I’ve helped multiple orgs enhance visibility, usability, and performance of their activity timelines. If you’ve ever wanted to:

1. Sort the timeline by custom date fields
2. Search within activity records
3. Display multiple key fields, not just descriptions
4. Include related object records like Opportunities, Cases, and more
5. View archived tasks and events seamlessly

…then this video is for you!

I'll also share insights on the Salesforce-provided Timeline Tool, its limitations, and a powerful Lightning Web Component (LWC link - https://quip.com/2Q4oAB2RLGnQ) solution that delivers a truly flexible and user-centric experience.

Whether you're a Salesforce Admin, Developer, or Architect—this walkthrough will help you design better activity experiences for advisors, agents, and RM teams.
